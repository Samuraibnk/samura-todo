# Samurai Todo ⚔️ (Day 1 — raw learning repo)

Current honest status (November 2025):
- I followed Grok step-by-step and did a lot of copy-paste.
- I broke things, got lost, and Grok fixed most bugs for me.
- BUT: I stayed until the very end, saw every single bug, and understood (at least at 60–70%) why each fix worked.

Goal for the next 7–10 days:
→ Come back to this exact repo, delete 90% of the code, and rewrite the entire app from scratch with almost zero help.
When that PR is merged, I’ll update this README to “I can now rebuild this blindfolded”.

That’s how real portfolios are built in 2025: show the messy learning process, then show the clean mastery later.
